                    <h1 class="text-success">How To Reach Andaman</h1>
                    <pre>The Andaman Islands can be reached by air or sea. 
                        By air: Flights to Andaman are easily available online. The capital city Port Blair has an air terminal named the Veer Savarkar International Airport which is very much associated with significant cities in India. Various carriers offer trips to Andaman including Air India, IndiGo, SpiceJet, Vistara, and GoAir.
                        By sea: The Andaman Islands can also be reached by sea. Regular passenger ships are operated by the Shipping Corporation of India between the Indian mainland and Port Blair. The journey by sea takes approximately 50-60 hours and the ships to Andaman usually depart from Chennai, Kolkata, and Visakhapatnam. However, this mode of transportation is not very popular due to the long travel time and unpredictable weather conditions. When you arrive at Port Blair, you can explore different islands in Andaman by taking ships and boats that work between various islands.</pre>

                    <h1 class="text-success">How To Reach Srilanka</h1>
                    <pre>Travelling to Sri Lanka by Air
                        The easiest way to get to Sri Lanka is by boarding a flight from India and reaching there on the same day of your departure. Sri Lanka has an air terminal bustling with travelers and it is known as the Bandaranaike Internal Airport. Situated in Colombo, Sri Lankan flights from the significant nations of the world land here. There are flights from India, Europe, Asia, Middle-East and Australia to Sri Lanka. However, as congestion increased, there was a need to tackle the increased air traffic and provide better immigration to tourists.
                        
                        The flights that operate from India to Sri Lanka are Air India, Jet Airways, Sri Lankan Airlines, Spice Jet and Vistara.  Flight duration from India to Sri Lanka may vary from 90 minutes to 3 hours 30 minutes depending on the airport.
                        
                        Travelling to Sri Lanka by Sea
                        Previously, ferry services used to operate from Chennai to Colombo that carried tourists from one country to the other at economic rates.  The 7-day cruise departs at Mumbai and reaches Colombo, taking you to all the major destinations like Kandy and Nuwara Eliya along the way. The rates usually depend on the luxury class you intend to travel in and also feature a few adventure and water sports during the course of the cruise.
                        
                        Travelling to Sri Lanka by Road
                        By Bus
                        Buses connect Colombo with the airport as well as the different destinations in Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka operates a wide system of buses throughout Sri Lanka, and the Central Bus Stand in Colombo serves as the pivotal point for all buses operating in and out of Colombo.</pre>
